about_text: >
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>RedHouse is the multi-disciplinary music studio of Gijs van Klooster.</p>
  <p>I want to create a sound image where all music and performance is according to the artist inspiration. When all decisions in sound creation are according to that one idea, you can create the best experience. <br />
  I believe that to be a devine experience.</p>
  <p>“Phaedrus felt that at the moment of pure Quality perception, or not even perception, at the moment of pure Quality there is no subject and there is no object. There is only a sense of Quality that produces a later awareness of subjects and objects. At the moment of pure quality, subject and object are identical.”</p>
