My first compositions were recorded on an analogue 4-track recorder. True love never dies they say, and Iâ€™m still recording music albeit as a professional. I am working as an independent music producer, composer and mixer in my own RedHouse studio. 

I had the opportunity to work with some of the greatest artists and producers including: [Erykah Badu](https://erykah-badu.com), [Knalpot](http://www.knalpot.eu), [Avi Adir](../projects/avi-adir-woods-awakening), [Tom Trago](https://www.tomtrago.com), [Tim Palmer](http://timpalmer.com) (David Bowie, U2), [Yoad Nevo](http://yoadnevo.com) (Pet Shop Boys, Sia), [Hans-Martin Buff](https://www.discogs.com/artist/351436-Hans-Martin-Buff) (Prince), [Niklas Paschburg](http://niklaspaschburg.com), [The Flexican](http://www.theflexican.com), [Brownswood](https://brownswoodrecordings.com), [Attie Bauw](http://bauwhaus.com), [Joep Beving](http://joepbeving.com) to name a few.
