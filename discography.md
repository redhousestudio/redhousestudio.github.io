As a producer I provide the experience and necessary perspective to guide a recording from start to finish. My objective is always to stand at the interface of music technology and people: improving the work that my clients produce and the music that their listeners experience.

I had the opportunity to work with some of the greatest artists and producers including: [Erykah Badu](https://erykah-badu.com), [Knalpot](http://www.knalpot.eu), [Avi Adir](../projects/avi-adir-woods-awakening), [Tom Trago](https://www.tomtrago.com), [Tim Palmer](http://timpalmer.com) (David Bowie, U2), [Yoad Nevo](http://yoadnevo.com) (Pet Shop Boys, Sia), [Hans-Martin Buff](https://www.discogs.com/artist/351436-Hans-Martin-Buff) (Prince), [Niklas Paschburg](http://niklaspaschburg.com), [The Flexican](http://www.theflexican.com), [Brownswood](https://brownswoodrecordings.com), [Attie Bauw](http://bauwhaus.com), [Joep Beving](http://joepbeving.com) to name a few.
