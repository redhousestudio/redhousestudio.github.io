It started with a kiss… on my new bass guitar… 13 years old. My first compositions were recorded in 1990 on an analogue 4-track recorder. True love never dies they say, and I’m still recording music albeit as a professional. After graduating Audio Design with honors at the [HKU](https://www.hku.nl/Home.htm) (2003) I am working as an independent music producer, composer and mixer and running my own studio. 

I had the opportunity to work with some of the greatest artists and producers including: Erykah Badu, Knalpot, Avi Adir, Tim Palmer, Yoad Nevo, Tom Trago, Hans-Martin Buff, Niklas Paschburg, The Flexican, Brownswood, Attie Bauw, Joep Beving to name a few.
