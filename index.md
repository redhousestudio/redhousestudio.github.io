  <p>RedHouse is the music studio of<br />composer / producer / engineer / sound-designer<br />Gijs van Klooster.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>



studio_section_text: >
  <p>RedHouse is a 'performance studio'. An intimate studio where musical ideas can be captured without interrupting the flow of a musician. One room where everybody is together working on the same thing. Lotsa instruments and toys available to play.</p>
  <p>And yes, I have Phase-Liner-Monitoring, and yes a fancy Millennia pre-amp too, and I could go on dropping names. But that is not the essence of a studio in my view.</p>
  <p>You just need a place that sounds good and where you feel comfortable - and a guy that knows how to work that sh*t.</p>


services_section_text_left: >
  <p>As a producer I provide the experience and necessary perspective to guide the recording process that often starts in a rehearsal room or home studio and ends in a mastering studio.</p>
  <p>Being a musician myself I know what it takes to perform, to make things work in the context of a composition.</p>


services_section_text_right: >
  <p>What drives me is to deliver a musical experience that really expresses the artistâ€™s inspiration. And make everything - from concept to final master - come together; performance, music, sound.</p>
  <p>If you want me involved in any or all phases of your musical journey, <a href="mailto:gijs@redhouse.nl" target="blank" class="red-link">get in touch</a> and we'll have a coffee.</p>
