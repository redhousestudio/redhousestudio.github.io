about_text: >
  <p>RedHouse is the music studio of composer/producer/engineer/sound-designer Gijs van Klooster.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I translate a musical idea into an experience for the listener.<br />
    But this is just a website.<br />
    <a href="mailto:gijs@redhouse.nl" target="blank" class="red-link">Get in touch</a> and we'll have a coffee.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Stay up to date on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gijsvankloostermusic" target="blank" class="red-link">Facebook</a> page.<p>

studio_section_text: >
  <p>RedHouse is a 'performance studio'. An intimate studio where musical ideas can be captured without interrupting the flow of a musician. One room where everybody is together working on the same thing. Lotsa instruments and toys available to play.</p>
  <p>And yes, I have Phase-Liner-Monitoring, and yes a fancy Millennia pre-amp too, and I could go on dropping names. But that is not the essence of a studio in my view.</p>
  <p>I have been composing and producing music for more than 30 years and I can help compose/arrange/perform your music, record it, mix it. Help you perform your songs, coach and guide you to get the best result.</p>
