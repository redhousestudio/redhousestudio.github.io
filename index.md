  <p>My RedHouse studio is a 'performance studio'. It’s an intimate place, where musical ideas can be captured without the flow being interrupted. Everybody is together in the same room, working on the same thing.</p>
  <p>And yes: I do have Phase-Linear-Monitoring, and a fancy Millennia pre-amp too. Plus: loads of  instruments and other musical toys available to play around with. I envisioned that a recording artist needs a place that sounds good, where they feel comfortable, and a guy that knows how to work all the buttons and faders.</p>
  <p>Based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.</p>

  <p><strong>Providing the experience and necessary perspective to guide an artist’s recording from start to finish.</strong></p>
  <p>After playing, composing and producing music for over 30 years in many genres, I’m more than experienced to cover the whole process - often starting in a rehearsal room or home studio and ending in a mastering studio.</p>


services_section_text_right: >
  <p>Delivering a musical listening experience that really expresses the artist’s inspiration, is what ultimately drives me. Making everything connect - from concept to final master - and tell the same story; performance, music, processing, mix .. sound.</p>
  <p>If you want me involved in any or all phases of your musical journey, <a href="mailto:gijs@redhouse.nl" target="blank" class="red-link">get in touch</a> for a cup of coffee.</p>
