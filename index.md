  <p>My RedHouse studio is a 'performance studio'. It’s an intimate place, where musical ideas can be captured without the flow being interrupted. Everybody is together in the same room, working on the same thing.</p>
  <p>And yes: I do have Phase-Linear-Monitoring, and a fancy Millennia pre-amp too. Plus: loads of  instruments and other musical toys available to play around with. I envisioned that a recording artist needs a place that sounds good, where they feel comfortable, and a guy that knows how to work all the buttons and faders.</p>

  <p>“Phaedrus felt that at the moment of pure Quality perception, or not even perception, at the moment of pure Quality there is no subject and there is no object. There is only a sense of Quality that produces a later awareness of subjects and objects. At the moment of pure Quality, subject and object are identical.”</p>

  <p><strong>Providing the experience and necessary perspective to guide an artist’s recording from start to finish.</strong></p>
  <p>After playing, composing, recording and producing music for over 30 years, I’m more than <a href="/discography" class="normal" target="" class="red-link">experienced</a> to cover the whole process - often starting in a rehearsal room or home studio and ending in a mastering studio.</p>


services_section_text_right: >
  <p>Delivering a musical listening experience that really expresses the artist’s inspiration, is what ultimately drives me. Making everything connect - from concept to final master - to build the musical story; performance, sound, processing, mix .. music.</p>
