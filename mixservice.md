  <p class="mixservice-tagline-big">Mix Service</p>
  <p>Hello, great that we’ll be working together, I love making sonic dreams come true!</p>
  <p>On this page you will find some technical details to prepare our session.</p>


whatismixing: >
  <p class="mixquote">Mixing is performing the perfect balance between all sounds and instruments to create a magical listening experience.</p>
  <p class="mixquote">It should be uniquely suited to the music and help tell the story that was created with sounds.</p>


timeline_intake: >
  <p>We can discuss the details using email, Facetime or Skype. If you have specific sonic dreams; let me know. Tell me what you envisioned when you created the music/composition. If you are able come to the studio, you are welcome to join me.</p>
  <p>I can help with the production of the tracks. If I think I can contribute something essential I will share my thoughts. And you can decide if we’ll make them audible. I can re-amp your synths, use analog filters, distortion, add bass, guitar, synths, or rhythm/groove programming, anything needed to make for maximum impact.</p>


timeline_mixing: >
  <p>I put the mixes on <a href="https://stacktune.com" class="normal" target="_blank" class="red-link">StackTune</a> so you can hear the results in high resolution. It’s a great tool to compare different versions and you can comment on the time line (or a time region) for clear communication. Take a look at their home page to get an overview of the features. I can send you mix files if you want, but please be aware that old mixes on hard discs might cause harmful mistakes and this online solution tries to prevent that.</p>
  <p>It’s only done when you say it’s done. I will mix and tweak till everybody is happy. It is my absolute joy to help you get the best results from your recordings and I don’t mind to keep tweaking to make sure all details are taken care of. If feedback rounds take much more time than normal I will notify you in advance and we’ll think of a solution that works for both of us.</p>


timeline_mastering: >
  <p>Normally I don’t master the tracks that I mixed. But there are many exceptions to that rule. We can discuss the best solution for you.<br />I can do the mastering or we send the mix to a mastering studio of your choice. I can connect you to mastering engineers which I think are really good.<br />I like to be involved in the mastering of the mixes to make sure we reach an optimum end result.</p>




boring_invoicing: >
  <p>€ 500 (ex BTW/VAT) per day per track is the norm. This does not apply to solo intruments or small groups and may vary based on the budget and complexity of the music. I am willing to talk about other options per project. I will send you an invoice for 50% before I start and the other 50% when everybody is happy.<br /><br /></p>

boring_sessionmedia: >
  <p>The mixed and/or mastered audio files will be delivered in any format you want. The session files (Logic Pro, Pro Tools, Audition etc.) used to create the mix and/or master will not be included unless we agreed otherwise.<br />Mixed stems for other purposes (e.g. remix) can be created no later than 90 days after session completion. For prices please contact me.<br /><br /></p>

boring_accreditation: >
  <p>You must ensure that the appropriate credits will be mentioned in all the label copy, artwork, print and social media related to the studio results reading substantially: “Mixed by Gijs van Klooster”.</p>
  <p>On Facebook use tag <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gijsvankloostermusic" class="normal" target="_blank" class="red-link">@gijsvankloostermusic</a>.<br />On Instagram use tag <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gijsvanklooster" class="normal" target="_blank" class="red-link">@gijsvanklooster</a><br />On Twitter use tag <a href="https://twitter.com/abcgijs" class="normal" target="_blank" class="red-link">@abcgijs</a><br />All others online credits should link to <a href="https://www.gijsvanklooster.com" class="normal" target="_blank" class="red-link">www.gijsvanklooster.com</a>.<br /><br /></p>
  <p>All instances of negligence will be charged accordingly.</p>

Some technical details about the files you will send me. 

##### <strong>Audio files</strong>

- Audio Formats: 24 bits, 44.1 or 48 kHz is perfect, but anything will do.
- All files must start from the same moment in time at the beginning of the song where there is no sound of any of the sources.
- All files should have clear and consistent naming: source, instrument, mic position, or what they sound like. Not "Audio 1", "Input 6", "SYNTH-4-87\_R\_25- 24b", etc. please.
- Provide all sound sources separately, no sub-mixes unless specified and to create an audible example.
- Bounce all the tracks with all faders (including master) on 0 dB without (volume or other) automation and without audio processing.
- If there is any volume automation and/or audio processing you think is important, add a version with the automation and/or processing.
- If you have already created a mixed version you really like (the rough mix) please include this and tell me what you like about it. Can be any kind of format: mp3, wav etc. 


##### <strong>Other files</strong>

- Create a text file with the BPM (if played to a click) and other things I need to know that guided the performances.
- Add pdf/text/doc files with all lyrics if your recording includes any singing and or spoken word.
- If you have any pictures of the recording setup (placement of microphones) please add those.
