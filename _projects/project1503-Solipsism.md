In 2013  Joep and I started sharing space and time in the RedHouse. We were old music colleagues and he moved all his music gear and studio equipment into the RedHouse in order to play and experiment. One day he asked me to help him release some recordings he made at home on his piano, the only instrument left in his house. I loved what I heard and wanted to help him. So I spent many hours mixing and mastering his home recordings â€” one track was even recorded on his phone! Together we developed
the thick phat piano sound that would become Joep's signature sound.

Little did we know what was about to happen. His album went all the way to the stars
and back, touching millions of lives with his gentle piano stories. Joep became an instant- worldwide-Spotify-phenomenon.

A beautiful video was made for this song:

Joep about working together:
<blockquote>
<p>Gijs, I really feel we did this one together.<br />Thank you for your fantastic spirit and for all the help and skills you have provided me with. The master sounds fantastic. Get ready for the next!</p>
</blockquote>

We have been closely working together ever since. I work with Joep on all music and sound related matters; produce, mix, coach, sound-design, studio/tape engineering, ... whatever.
We started production for his second album [Prehension](../joep-beving-prehension) immediately.

In 2017 the album was re-released on the legendary [Deutsche Grammophon](https://www.deutschegrammophon.com/en/cat/4797469?).
