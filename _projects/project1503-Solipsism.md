Joep moved all his studio equipment to the RedHouse long time ago. At that time we just shared space and time in my studio. One day he asked me to help him release some recordings he made at home on his piano, the only instrument left in his house. I loved it and wanted to help my friend. Many hours I mixed and mastered his home recordings (1 track recorded on his iPhone!) and togehter we developed the thick phat piano sound that would become Joep's signature sound.

Little did we know what was about to happen... Joep's album went all the way to the stars and back, touching millions of lives with his gentle piano stories. He became a instant-worldwide-Spotify-phenomenon with this album.

A beautiful video was made for this song:

Joep about working together:
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your fantastic spirit and for all the help and skills you have provided me with.</p>
</blockquote>

We have been closely working together ever since. I work with Joep on all music and sound related matters; produce, mix, coach, sound-design, studio/tape engineering, ... whatever.

In 2017 the album was re-released on the legendary [Deutsche Grammophon](https://www.deutschegrammophon.com/en/cat/4797469?).
