Producer Attie Bauw asked me to join him on a journey to Poland where we would record an opera for "Samson et Dalila, the movie" produced by Opera Spanga. We created a 5.1 surround recording of a 120 piece orchestra and choir and lead singers in a booth.

Produced by Opera Spanga (Corina van Eijk en Maartje de Wit) and conducted by David Levi. Recorded in Katowice, Poland.

A great time with great people.
