![Joep Beving - Henosis](../../img/project1903-image02.png)

‘Henosis’ is the closing chapter of the trilogy that started with [Solipsism](../joep-beving-solipsism/) and [Prehension](../joep-beving-prehension/).

Creating this album took more than a year and was a big production recording [Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg](https://filmorchester.de/de/) in their beautiful [studio](https://filmorchester.de/de/Scoring-Stage/Saal/index.php), the [Echo Collective](https://www.echocollective.be) in [Jet Sound](https://www.jetstudio.com) and [Cappella Amsterdam](https://www.cappellaamsterdam.nl) in [Wisseloord](https://www.wisseloord.nl). All piano and electronics were created and recorded in my RedHouse studio (except were [indicated](https://www.discogs.com/Joep-Beving-Henosis/release/13476911)). 

I will write some posts [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gijsvankloostermusic/) about the process and thoughts that went into the creation. For now: enjoy this journey that will take you to many places, in your head and into space!

Henosis - a film created by [Rahi Rezvani](http://www.rahirezvani.com) in 3 Movements:

>"this rich amalgamation of electrical sounds and classical traditions are realized perfectly with history resolving itself into present moments. Henosis is a music searching for something lost. And now found."

>"A touching and beautiful masterpiece, with an absolute nice and warm production."

>"... We then find ourselves in a game of communicating vessels: here we draw the fragrances of the classical repertoire, there elements of electronic rhythm. One feeds on the other."
