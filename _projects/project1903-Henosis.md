![Joep Beving - Henosis](../../img/project1903-image02.png)

We long wanted to go beyond the piano and introduce synthesizers, choir and orchestra in Joeps music because we both come from a more electronic music background. It only happened ever so slightly in [Impermanence](https://open.spotify.com/track/0PPT4yPxqa5FNWkXpyKvsI?si=SbH6bgutSS-rFF25ak1diA) on Prehension. In the closing chapter of of the trilogy that started with [Solipsism](../joep-beving-solipsism/) and [Prehension](../joep-beving-prehension/) Joep wanted to go deeper.

The demos for Henosis were finished in 2017 and it took the most of 2018 to transcribe, record and mix all tracks.

Strings and choir were orchestrated by [Max Knoth](https://www.maxknoth.de) and we recorded [Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg](https://filmorchester.de/de/) in their amazing [studio](https://filmorchester.de/de/Scoring-Stage/Saal/index.php), the [Echo Collective](https://www.echocollective.be) in [Jet Sound](https://www.jetstudio.com) and [Cappella Amsterdam](https://www.cappellaamsterdam.nl) in [Wisseloord](https://www.wisseloord.nl). Organ recorded by [Misja van den Burg](https://misjavandenburg.com) in a New York church. 3 tracks were produced and mixed by [Maarten Vos](https://maartenvos.com). 

It was a great project with great people. Recording and mixing more than 500 tracks (in different tunings) into 2. Creating a sonic journey of almost 2 hours of shapes and Joeps stories, blending acoustics and electronics, classical and the present moment.

Mastered by [Zino Mikorey](https://www.zinomikorey.com).

Thanks to Joep for taking me on these musical adventures and [Christian Badzura](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-badzura-64b49716/?originalSubdomain=de), A&R of [Deutsche Grammophon](https://www.deutschegrammophon.com/), for his advice and feedback.

In November 2019 we were honoured to receive the [Dutch Edison Award](https://www.edisons.nl/klassiek/nieuws/winnaars-edison-klassiek-2019-bekend/)🏆.
