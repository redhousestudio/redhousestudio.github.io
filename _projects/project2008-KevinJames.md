I met Kevin after a concert on a festival. I was so touched by the way he captivated the audience with his good-vibe-mantra-music and saw how people come alive and all started to sing and dance!

We build a really special bond over a long distance since then. We never saw each other again in the same space but it didn't stop us to produce this beautiful album together. With all the available technology I feel there are no borders for what I do. I added programming and recorded some drum and bass parts in my studio.

Kevin about working together:
<blockquote>
<p>As a world travelling musician for more than a decade I've worked with lots of sound engineers and producers from around the world. I think it's pretty easy to distinguish their particular taste by their existing work but what's important for me to know is not so simple.<br />
Can I trust this person with my music, to keep their word, to be clear, capture what I want in the quality that I need, without hassle or extra surprises and deliver on time?</p>

<p>Gijs was a pleasant surprise for me. He listened and understood my music and message first with the clear intention to enhance it. To capture the magic without invading or detracting from the original music.<br />

My experience with Gijs was flawless and his taste in production worked perfectly for me also which I think was a reflection of his good intentions.<br /> 
Somehow he brings out the best in you but keeping it sounding so natural and real, and tastefully adding a little extra spice like a master chef.</p>

<p> He did everything I asked of him and more. I loved working with him and highly recommend him as a good natured and easygoing person as well.
