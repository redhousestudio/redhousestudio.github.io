![Benjamin de Murashkin - Harmonia](../../img/project1909-image01.png)

Like a moving soundtrack, to no film in particular, Harmonia is an album with a fresh take on what genre-busting between the realms of true classical and electronic music sounds like. 

Benjamin is an accomplished composer, having worked with orchestras and ensembles throughout Scandinavia and beyond. Studying at conservatories in both Australia and Denmark he brings with him a varied background and an openness to multiple influences.

Benjamin single-handedly produced, arranged, composed, performed and recorded eight classical tracks in his home studio. (Only with the help of 1 cello player and 1 horn player.) He came to me with almost 1000 individual tracks over a timespan of 54 minutes, and he gave me a free hand in mixing and sound-design to make all the parts work as-one.
