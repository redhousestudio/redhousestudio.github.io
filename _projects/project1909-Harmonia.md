![Benjamin de Murashkin - Harmonia](../../img/project1909-image01.png)

Benjamin is an accomplished composer, having worked with orchestras and ensembles throughout Scandinavia and beyond. Studying at conservatories in both Australia and Denmark he brings with him a varied background and an openness to multiple influences.

Like a moving soundtrack, to no film in particular, Harmonia is an album with a fresh take on what genre-busting between the realms of true classical and electronic music sounds like. 

A passion project that took him 2 years. He single-handedly produced, arranged, composed, performed and recorded eight classical tracks in his home studio. (Only with the help of 1 cello player and 1 horn player.) 

We worked on the last details in my studio and I can tell you mixing close to 1000 individual recordings was one of the most challenging and satisfying things I ever did. Proud to present:

Benjamin about working together:
<blockquote>
<p>I came to Gijs with what I thought was a finished project that just needed some mixing. But when he started working on it and I heard the potential of what he was managing to get out of the music I was inspired to take what I was hearing and to keep developing it. It turned into a collaborative process which is something I can’t wait to get back into with him again.</p>
<p>Gijs was a dream to work with, never feeling like there was judgment underway, just useful feedback which created the perfect flow of creativity. Long story short, if the man starts his own cult I’ll be the first to sign up for my seat on the spaceship.</p>
