Jan Bunel is a young rising piano player from the Netherlands. 
He has been writing neoclassical piano pieces for a number of years and took a deep dive to carefully record all his ideas. Recorded in my studio on a beautiful Perzina piano that we could use from [Bol Pianos](https://bolpianos.nl).

And succesfully so; his first five singles have been streamed almost a million times over a period of five months. The full album will be released on November 5.
