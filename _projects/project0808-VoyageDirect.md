The basics of Tom Trago's track were already there when he came to me. It just did not have the punch and “yeah” feeling that was potentially there. We worked on
the structure of the track to make sure each element would have maximum impact. I added synths and sound design and mixed it as loud as possible.<br />
Tom found the place in the studio where the bass was loudest, and stood there listening while I was mixing ;) I asked him to draw the position of his feet on my wooden floor, for anyone to know. Play it loud!
