Lavinia needs no introduction. She is one of the world greatest harp player and has won numerous prizes and her album "Metamorphosis / The Hours" (Philip Glass) was awarded Platinum Record.

I was honoured to create this special album with her. When she plays the harp it transforms the space and we went on a journey that led to this beautiful and personal album. For the first time she wanted to record her own compositions and we worked on the intimate performances together.


This is the first single, a beautiful song by Ã“lafur Arnalds.
