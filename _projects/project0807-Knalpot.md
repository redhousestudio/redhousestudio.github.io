All compositions for the first album of impro-musicians Gerri Jaeger and Raphael Vanoli were ready to record after playing them live on many international stages.<br />
During pre- production we discussed the sound and I studied their performances. We wanted to capture the fun and raw energy of their live shows and translated this energy into the recordings. We kicked ass, “pom pom”, had lots of fun.<br />
A great project to have worked on because I like strong ideas and personalities and their music is something really unique.

Knalpot about working together:
<blockquote>
<p>Gijs van Klooster did an excellent job on the very first Knalpot recording ever made. He managed to captivate the in-your-face roughness Knalpot then had and made our tracks shine in clear powerful and warm sound.</p>
