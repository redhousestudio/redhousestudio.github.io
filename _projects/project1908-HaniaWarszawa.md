More piano bliss by the beautiful Hania Rani. Released by [7K](http://7k.k7.com) on the compilation "Piano layers".

Hania wrote: "The piece is dedicated to the city where I live. [...] I was trying to catch the atmosphere of the city, which is in a constant movement, directed to the future. But also adding a blast of melancholy, nostalgia, telling the difficult story of it's past."
