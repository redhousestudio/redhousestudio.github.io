After the succefull debut album [Esja](../hania-rani-esja/), Leaving is the first single of the new album "Home" that we mixed in my studio. Hania took some bold steps in new musical territories. The album has many new Hania-flowing-flavours that you will love. Here's one:

Hania about working together:
<blockquote>
<p>What I was happy to learn by working with Gijs that he always tries to understand your vision and find your style. He is very experienced and a musician himself, and he is open to another person ideas and trying to help make them happen. He has a huge knowledge about technical stuff and all music genres.<br />
What I appreciate is that I actually also learnt a lot about producing, mixing, performing and writing music - we spent a lot of time simply talking about music and exploring things that we like. Gijs was also keen to know more about me as a person to understand more my vision of music and art.</p>
<p>I was very happy with the result of the mixing of my first album "<a href="../hania-rani-esja/" class="normal" target="" >Esja</a>", it sounded great both on digital version and vinyl and managed to bring my ideas in an accessible way. It was an obvious decision for me to work once again together on my second album "Home", way more complex than the first, minimalistic one.<br />
I hope we have still some records ahead of us!</p>
