After the acclaimed debut album [Esja](../hania-rani-esja/) Hania took some bold steps in new musical territories with her new album Home that we finished and mixed in my studio.

Speaking of the new album Hania said: “One can be lost but can find home in his inner part - which can mean many things - soul, imagination, mind, intuition, passion. I strongly believe that when being in uncertain times and living an unstable life we can still reach peace with ourselves and be able to find ‘home’ anywhere’ This is what I would like to express with my music - one can travel the whole world but not see anything. It is not where we are going but how much we are able to see and hear things happening around us”. 

The album has many new Hania-flowing-flavours that you will love. Here's one:

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/15/witch-n-monk-witch-n-monk-review):
>"sounding like a young Kate Bush.."

[The line of best fit](https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/hania-rani-home-album-review):
>"As a whole, Home is a beautiful album, encompassing all which home is and isn't. The addition of gentle, mediative electronic elements to Rani's palette elevates her storytelling .."



Hania about working together:
<blockquote>
<p>What I was happy to learn by working with Gijs that he always tries to understand your vision and find your style. He is very experienced and a musician himself, and he is open to another person ideas and trying to help make them happen. He has a huge knowledge about technical stuff and all music genres.<br />
What I appreciate is that I actually also learnt a lot about producing, mixing, performing and writing music - we spent a lot of time simply talking about music and exploring things that we like. Gijs was also keen to know more about me as a person to understand more my vision of music and art.</p>
<p>I was very happy with the result of the mixing of my first album "<a href="../hania-rani-esja/" class="normal" target="" >Esja</a>", it sounded great both on digital version and vinyl and managed to bring my ideas in an accessible way. It was an obvious decision for me to work once again together on my second album "Home", way more complex than the first, minimalistic one.<br />
I hope we have still some records ahead of us!</p>
