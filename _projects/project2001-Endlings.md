Earth’s sixth mass extinction is well under way. For years conservationists have been warning of an event akin to the one that wiped out the dinosaurs – only this time, we are to blame. ‘Endlings’ is Amsterdam-based composer, performer and producer Evelien van den Broek’s sonic response to this man made “biological annihilation”. 

Using field recordings of extinct or endangered animals gathered from sound libraries, scientists, and the pioneering soundscape ecologist Bernie Krause, ‘Endlings’ immerses us in obsolete soundworlds, reconnecting us with our natural environment through sound. Raw, mesmerising and sorrowful music celebrates the wonder, beauty and diversity of nature, and mourns the brutal destruction of it. 

With music that navigates between electronica and pop, sound art and contemporary classical music. The album contains the music of the Biophonica live show about extinction, which premiered in November 2019.
