After we created the breakthrough album [Solipsism](http://www.redhouse.nl/projects/joep-beving-solipsism/), Joep and I decided to start working on a new album immediately. And we began a journey too make sure we would deliver the best sounding piano album ever. Making sure all the pieces would fit together, molding the compositions to completion. I asked Joep to tune the piano down to 432 Hz (normally 440 Hz) for reasons that can only be experienced.

After the recordings Joep signed with the legendary [Deutsche Grammophon](http://www.deutschegrammophon.com/en/cat/4797151?) where he is currently the best selling artist.

A short movie was made to introduce the album:

Joep thanked me on his Facebook page with these kind words:
