After we made the breakthrough album Solipsism, Joep and I decided we start working on a new one immediately. We tuned the piano down a bit to 432 Hz (normally 440 Hz) for reasons that can only be experienced. And we began a journey of closely working on all the pieces, too make sure we would deliver the best piano album ever. Making sure all the pieces would together, shaping the album to completion.

After the recordings Joep signed with the most famous record company in classical music [Deutsche Grammophon](http://www.deutschegrammophon.com/en/cat/4797151?).

Joep thanked me on his Facebook page with these kind words:

And we even made it to [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/13/joep-beving-dutch-pianist-spotify-star-solipsism):

>"From kitchen composer to Spotify star - Dutch pianist hits big time... the way itâ€™s recorded, engineered and mixed, it sounds so big"
