![Joep Beving - Prehension](../../img/project1610-image02.png)

After the breakthrough album [Solipsism](../joep-beving-solipsism/) was released, Joep Beving and I started to work on the many new songs and ideas. It was a beautiful journey together. To perfect the beautiful piano stories that Joep created in every detail, we molded every moment of every track: the feel, the intention, the tempi, the loudness and softness, even a deviated tuning of the piano, and we synthesized it all together as a whole. Recorded and mixed in my RedHouse studio.

Mastering by [Darcy Proper](http://www.wisseloord.nl/mastering/) to make sure it was ready for the large audience that Joep‚Äôs music had found.


This album was signed with the legendary [Deutsche Grammophon](http://www.deutschegrammophon.com/en/cat/4797151?) label.<br />

In April 2019 the album received the [Golden Record Award](https://www.luister.nl/pianist-joep-beving-ontvangt-gouden-plaat/)üèÜ in the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.

I am so proud of what we have accomplished. We never dreamed this big; we just wanted to make beautiful piano music. This album has touched millions of people and has changed our lives forever, in a good way. Thank you!

>"It‚Äôs just an upright piano. But the way it‚Äôs recorded, engineered and mixed, it sounds so big."
