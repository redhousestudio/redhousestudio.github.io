Avi Adir is an amazing multi instrumentalist, plays concerts all over the world, and makes an impression and friends everywhere he performs. 

When he came to me, he didn't have much experience and did not really know how to make an album. Lot's of idea's and instruments to play, but no clear vision of what the album should be. And how to bring those worldly sounds into a cohesive album. Together we created an imaginary map to travel (yes on a sheet of paper) and that gave him the possibility to compose and perform the different idea's and instruments like traveling to different places. It was a wonderful journey recording the intense performances of Avi on so many different instruments.
