One day Billy Queen walked into my studio and wanted to record some tracks she wrote. With barely 3 fingers on the piano she played the songs to me and I really liked them! We both loved the old soul sound so much so we aimed for an old scool soul vibe for her songs. 

1. As Time Goes By

And for one of the songs a fancy video clip was made:
