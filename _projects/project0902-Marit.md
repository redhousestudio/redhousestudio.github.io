One day Billy Queen walked into my studio and wanted to record some tracks she wrote. With barely 3 fingers on the piano she played some songs to me and I was impressed. We both loved the old soul sound so much so we aimed for an old scool soul vibe for her songs. 

A beautiful clip was made for the first single Christmas Baby, composed by Billie Queen and Gijs van Klooster:

Drums by Stefan Kruger. Bariton sax and solo on Christmas Baby by Christan Grotenbrecht. All other instruments by yours truly.
