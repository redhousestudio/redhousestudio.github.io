Bob's Green is my band. I've played with them forever and they are my best friends. I play bass and synthesizers and record and produce sometimes with them. But it's my hobby project, we jam funky jazzy improvised rhythms in all signatures you can dream of. Merijn Bolink playes keyboards and Phillip ten Bosch plays the drums.  
We kick shit every time we play together.

This is a track we were asked to create for a short movie.

Pretty neat compared to what we noramlly sound like ;)
