Marlies is a "classical-meets-minimal" composer and pianist that has worked on various projects. She composed for theater and cabaret and performed her music together with the [Metropole Orchestra](https://www.mo.nl/) and [Andre Heuvelman](https://marliesdumosch.com/enchantement/).

She [crowdfunded](https://www.voordekunst.nl/projecten/8502-marlies-du-mosch-tale-of-a-city-1) the making of her first solo album. Fourteen compositions inspired by the silence that you can sometimes find in the middle of the bustle of a big city.
The composition of Marlies create a new world, mingling space and thoughts of your mind with her unique musical patterns.

Together we carefully prepared the recordings by practicing the performances in great detail. We created a strong bond that lasts till this day. Recorded on the Steinway grand piano in the beautiful [Wisseloord Studio 1](https://www.wisseloord.org/studios/studio-1/) Marlies proved to be a one take wonder.
