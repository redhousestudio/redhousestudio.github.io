[Francesco Catitti](https://www.instagram.com/thekatoo/) ordered me to record and mix the piano parts and help with the sound and emotional layering of the new album of [Michele Bravi](https://www.instagram.com/michelebravi/). I flew to Venice a few weeks later and was welcomed by my Italian family. We worked in the beautiful [Basement studio](https://www.instagram.com/thebasementvicenza/) on all the parts played by the amazing person and performer [Andrea Manzoni](https://www.instagram.com/andreamanzoniofficial/). I will never forget the good food and inspiration of this dream team.

First single is out!

Francesco about working together:
<blockquote>
<p>Working with Gijs was such a perfect artistic and human experience: the guy has both the competence and the musical sensibility required to make your record come to life. And it was so much fun! And, most importantly, the record sounds awesome.</p>
