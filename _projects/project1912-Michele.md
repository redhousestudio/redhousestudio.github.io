[Francesco Catitti](https://www.instagram.com/thekatoo/) ordered me to record and mix the piano parts and help with the sound and emotional layering of the new album he was producing for [Michele Bravi](https://www.instagram.com/michelebravi/). I flew to Venice a few weeks later and was welcomed by my Italian family.<br />
We worked in the beautiful [Basement studio](http://www.basementgroup.it) where I recorded all the piano parts played by [Andrea Manzoni](https://www.instagram.com/andreamanzoniofficial/). I will never forget the good food and inspiration of this dream team.

I made the bass for Tutte le poesie and additional sound design for Storia del mio corpo.

Francesco about working together:
<blockquote>
<p>Working with Gijs was such a perfect artistic and human experience: the guy has both the competence and the musical sensibility required to make your record come to life. And it was so much fun! And, most importantly, the record sounds awesome.</p>
