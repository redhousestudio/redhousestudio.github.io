[Francesco Catitti](https://www.instagram.com/thekatoo/) ordered me to record and mix the piano part of the new album of Michele Bravi. I flew to Venice a few weeks later and was welcomed by my family I never met before. We worked in the beautiful [Basement studio](https://www.instagram.com/thebasementvicenza/) on all the parts played by [Andrea Manzoni](https://www.instagram.com/andreamanzoniofficial/). The whole process felt like a family diner and we had so much fun creating this magic together. I will never forget the good food and inspiration of this dream team.

First single is out!

Francesco about working together:
<blockquote>
<p>Working with Gijs was such a perfect artistic and human experience: the guy has both the competence and the musical sensibility required to make your record come to life. And it was so much fun! And, most importantly, the record sounds awesome.</p>
