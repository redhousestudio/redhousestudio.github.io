Somebody played me some demo's of Niklas' music for the first time in the car and I was immediately attracted to his music. We met in the studio of Niklas and started working on the material Niklas had recorded. We shaped the story of all tracks into a dreamy memory of the sea. I contributed basslines, melodies and sound programming. Few tracks were recorded again and I mixed everything in the RedHouse.

The album entered the Billboard Classical chart Februari 2018.

The first single:

Testimonial:

>"When I first send him my music, Gijs directly dives into the music and let me see my own music in a new light. I always felt safe and easily could confide my music in his hands. He helped me translate my ideas into my record and with his special technical knowledge achieved a next level in the music I never expected. But it was more than just the technical side of producing a record. We talked a lot about the idea, story and concept behind the music. I got very inspired of all our talks about music and production which helped me a lot for further projects. 
It was a wonderful journey during the production of the album and Iâ€™m more than happy what came out of this time!
Niklas"
