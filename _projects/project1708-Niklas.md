![Niklas Paschburg - Oceanic](../../img/project1708-image01.png)

The recorded material that Niklas Paschburg presented to me had many really good parts and performances, but it lacked clarity in sounds, mix and composition. Niklas told me what he wanted to express with each song and we then shaped the story of all tracks into a dreamy memory of the sea.<br />
I contributed grooves, bass-lines, melodies and sound-design. We recorded a few tracks again and I mixed everything in the RedHouse.

The album entered the Billboard Classical chart Februari 2018.

Niklas about working together:
<blockquote>
<p>When I first send him my music, Gijs directly dived into the music and let me see my own music in a new light. I always felt safe and easily could confide my music in his hands.</p>
<p>He helped me translate my ideas into my record and with his special technical knowledge achieved a next level in the music I never expected.<br />
But it was more than just the technical side of producing a record. We talked a lot about the idea, story and concept behind the music. I got very inspired of all our talks about music and production which helped me a lot for further projects.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful journey during the production of the album and Iâ€™m more than happy what came out of this time!</p>
<p>Niklas</p>
