Somebody played me some demo's of Niklas' music for the first time in the car and I was immediately attracted to his music. We met in the studio of Niklas and started working on the material Niklas had recorded. We shaped the story of all tracks into a dreamy memory of the sea. I contributed basslines, melodies and sound programming. Few tracks were recorded again and I mixed everything in the RedHouse.

The album entered the Billboard Classical chart Februari 2018.

The first single:
