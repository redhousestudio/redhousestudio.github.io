<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### <strong>Cancellations</strong>

Cancellations less than 7 day’s before session start will not be accepted unless we can rebook your time. This includes weekends and holidays. Cancellations as a result of adverse weather conditions such as snow will be rescheduled.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="payment"></a>
#### <strong>Payment</strong>

Client must pay 50% of the cost of each session as a confirmed session booking. The deposit must be paid 5 days before the studio session starts. The remainder of the studio bill should be paid in full on the last day of your session.

Failure to produce full payment will result in withholding of the studio session time, all copies of recordings, masters and/or session files until all fees due have been paid. No session media will be turned over to Client until full payment is made.

You must pay for the full amount of hours you book; it’s not our responsibility to manage your studio time.

If the recording session is broken up over a period of time, payment will be required to cover time that has been used.
Clients will also be responsible for all actual legal, attorney and collection fees, if required for payment and/or the use of the RedHouse studio. If an account is not paid in full, RedHouse will ask you to pay as soon as possible. If you don’t respond immediate collection and legal action will be taken. Client will also accrue a 1.5% interest charge per month until it is paid in full.

Receipt of recording media from Studio to Client is acknowledgement between both parties that the quality of all services rendered by RedHouse is satisfactory to Client and shall release RedHouse from any and all liability regarding said recording media and services rendered.

#### <strong>Session media</strong>

Session media will only be released when full payment for the session is received. Once session media has been turned over to the Client RedHouse is no longer expected to maintain a backup copy of the session unless other arrangements have been made in writing. We recommend that each Client make a back-up copy of the session media immediately. Session media left beyond 56 days due to non-payment become the property of RedHouse. 

All session files are deleted from RedHouse hard drives 90 days after session completion unless otherwise specified. Please bring a backup storage device if you require your recordings. RedHouse is not responsible for any unrecoverable data or software/hardware issues on your side.

Mixed stems for other purposes (e.g. remix) can be created no later than 90 days after session completion. There is an additional fee per track, for prices please contact RedHouse.

Set up time will be billed at regular studio rates unless other arrangements are agreed to in writing. This includes load-in and instrument setup, microphone placement, level setting, media transfer, etc.
