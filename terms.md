## RedHouse Studio

###  Policies, Terms & Conditions

When booking a session at RedHouse you are entering into a contract by which you are agreeing unconditionally on behalf of the artist/band to abide by the studio’s terms and conditions as detailed below. I’ll try to keep it as simple as possible.

### <strong>Booking</strong>
Sessions are booked at the rates as agreed by both parties. There is a 4 hour minimum. But normally you’ll pay by day. Working hours may vary but should not exceed 10 hours. Sessions that run longer than this will be charged at a € 80 per hour rate assuming the studio is available. 

Bookings are made by the following methods only. Phone: 06-26240067 Email:gijs@redhouse.nl and are not valid until confirmed.

RedHouse studio reserves the right to refuse and reschedule any confirmed bookings.


<a name="cancellations"></a>
### <strong>Cancellations</strong>
Cancellations will not be accepted less than 7 day’s before session start unless we can rebook your time. This includes weekends and holidays. Cancellations as a result of adverse weather conditions such as snow will be rescheduled.


<a name="payment"></a>
### <strong>Payment</strong>
It is the responsibility of the artist to cover 50% of the cost of each session as a confirmed session booking. The deposit must be paid 10 days before the studio session starts. The remainder of the studio bill should be paid in full on the first day of your session.

Failure to produce full payment will result in the studio withholding session time, all copies of recordings, masters or session files until all fees have been paid. No session media will be turned over to you until full payment is made for the hours spend.

You must pay for the full amount of hours you book; it’s not our responsibility to manage your studio time.

If the recording session is broken up over a period of time (8hrs+), payment will be required to cover time that has been used. RedHouse management reserves the right to implement these payment terms where applicable. 

Clients will also be responsible for all legal, attorney and collection fees, if required for payment. If an account is not paid in full, I will call you to ask you to pay. If you don’t respond immediate collection and legal action will be taken. Clients will also accrue a 1.5% interest charge per month until it is paid in full

Receipt of recording media from Studio to Client is acknowledgement between both parties that the quality of all services rendered by RedHouse is satisfactory to Client and shall release RedHouse from any and all liability regarding said recording media and services rendered.


<a name="session-media"></a>
### <strong>Session media</strong>
Session media will only be released when full payment for the session is received. Once session media has been turned over to the client RedHouse is no longer expected to maintain a backup copy of the session unless other arrangements have been made in writing. We recommend that each client make a back-up copy of the sessions immediately. Session materials left beyond 42 days due to nonpayment become the property of RedHouse. 
All session files are deleted from RedHouse hard drives 90 days after session completion unless otherwise specified. Please bring a backup storage device if you require your recordings. RedHouse is not responsible for any unrecoverable data or software/hardware issues on your side.


<a name="session-times"></a>
### <strong>Start/end and session times</strong>
The session clock begins at the scheduled time that both parties agree upon. If you arrive early and the studio can accommodate an early start, then the session clock will begin at that time. If you are late for any reason, you will be charged from the scheduled session start time, with no exceptions. Please call if you are going to be late! Set up time will be billed at regular studio rates unless other arrangements are agreed to. This includes load-in and instrument setup, microphone placement, level setting, media transfer, etc.


<a name="studio-downtime"></a>
### <strong>Studio downtime</strong>
Unforeseen problems can happen; If session downtime occurs at the fault of the studios equipment, that time will not be billed. The studios liability shall be limited strictly to the studio time of the booked session and clients agree to hold RedHouse harmless from any damages from such downtime.


<a name="damages"></a>
### <strong>Breakages and damages to studio equipment</strong>
In the event a piece of studio gear owned by RedHouse or any part of its facility becomes damaged by you, or anyone in your party, due to negligence, accident, or willful act, you agree to provide monetary compensation in the amount of full replacement value of the damaged item. Damage to the studio property of any kind that are a result of anyone in client's party or group will be assessed to client's account. If an item of equipment is damaged or missing at the start of your session please report it to the session technician/engineer immediately.
