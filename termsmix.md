# Mix Service

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### <strong>Audio files</strong>

- Audio Formats: 24 bits, 44.1 or 48 kHz is perfect, but anything will do.
- All files must start from the same moment in time at the beginning of the song where there is no sound of any of the sources.
- All files should have clear naming: what source, instrument, mix position, or what they sound like. Not "Audio 1", "Input 6", etc. please.
- All sound sources separate. No sub-mixes please. Only sub-mix to create an example for me.
- Please bounce all the tracks with all faders (including master) on 0 dB without volume automation and without audio processing.
- If there is any volume automation and/or audio processing you think is important, add a version with the automation and/or processing.
- If you have a mix you really like please include this and explain what you like about it. Can be anything: mp3, wav etc. 
- If a source is mono, don't make a stereo file if possible.

### <strong>Other files</strong>

- If there are any vocals that sing text please add pdf/text/doc files with all lyrics.
- If there are any pictures of the recording situation (placement of microphones) please add those.
- Make a text file with the BPM (if played to a click) and other things I need to know.

### <strong>Session media</strong>
Session media will only be released when full payment for the session is received. Once session media has been turned over to the client RedHouse is no longer expected to maintain a backup copy of the session unless other arrangements have been made in writing. We recommend that each client make a back-up copy immediately. 

Session materials left beyond 42 days due to nonpayment become the property of RedHouse. 

All session files are deleted from RedHouse hard drives 90 days after session completion unless otherwise specified.

Mixed stems for other purposes (e.g. remix) can be created no later than 90 days after session completion. There is an additional fee per track. For prices please contact me.
