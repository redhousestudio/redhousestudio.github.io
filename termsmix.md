# Mix Service

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Hello!
To make our mix session go smooth I wanted to share some information about how I like to work.


#### <strong>Audio files</strong>

- Audio Formats: 24 bits, 44.1 or 48 kHz is perfect, but anything will do.
- All files must start from the same moment in time at the beginning of the song where there is no sound of any of the sources.
- All files should have clear naming: what source, instrument, mix position, or what they sound like. Not "Audio 1", "Input 6", etc. please.
- All sound sources separate. No sub-mixes please. Only sub-mix to create an example for me.
- Please bounce all the tracks with all faders (including master) on 0 dB without volume automation and without audio processing.
- If there is any volume automation and/or audio processing you think is important, add a version with the automation and/or processing.
- If you have a mix you really like please include this and explain what you like about it. Can be anything: mp3, wav etc. 
- If a source is mono, don't make a stereo file if possible.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### <strong>Other files</strong>

- If there are any vocals that sing text please add pdf/text/doc files with all lyrics.
- If there are any pictures of the recording situation (placement of microphones) please add those.
- Make a text file with the BPM (if played to a click) and other things I need to know.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### <strong>Session media</strong>
Only the mixed files will be delivered. Unless other arrangements are agreed to in writing the session files (Logic Pro, Audition etc.) used to create the mix will not be included.

Please read the general [RedHouse Terms and Conditions](../terms#session-media) about session media but I want to repeat that mixed stems for other purposes (e.g. remix) can be created no later than 90 days after session completion. There is an additional fee per track. For prices please contact me.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### <strong>Accreditation</strong>

Unless agreed otherwise in writing and taking into account the best practices in the music industry, you must ensure that the appropriate credits of Gijs van Klooster shall be mentioned in all the artwork, print and social media related to the studio results reading substantially: "<em>Mixed by Gijs van Klooster</em>".
