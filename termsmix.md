# Mix Service

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Hello, great that we'll be working together, I love making sonic dreams come true.

To prepare our session I wanted to share some technical details about how I like to work. This enables me to put as much time possible on actual mixing.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### <strong>Audio files</strong>

- Audio Formats: 24 bits, 44.1 or 48 kHz is perfect, but anything will do.
- All files must start from the same moment in time at the beginning of the song where there is no sound of any of the sources.
- All files should have clear and consistent naming: what source, instrument, mix position, or what they sound like. Not "Audio 1", "Input 6", "SYNTH-4-87\_R\_25- 24b", etc. please.
- For mono sources please don't send a stereo file.
- All sound sources separate, no sub-mixes. Unless specified and/or to create an example for me.
- Please bounce all the tracks with all faders (including master) on 0 dB without (volume or other) automation and without audio processing.
- If there is any volume automation and/or audio processing you think is important, add a version with the automation and/or processing.
- If you have a mixed version made elsewhere you really like (the rough mix) please include this and explain what you like about it. Can be anything: mp3, wav etc. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### <strong>Other files</strong>

- If there are any vocals singing words please add pdf/text/doc files with all lyrics.
- If there are any pictures of the recording situation (placement of microphones) please add those.
- Make a text file with the BPM (if played to a click) and other things I need to know.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### <strong>Session Timeline</strong>
We will be in touch about all the details using email or Skype or whatever you prefer.

I can help with the production of the tracks if I feel I can contribute something essestial. I will make suggestions and you decide if we'll make them audible. I have have many toys in my studio and sometimes they can help to make the sound/expression better/stronger. I can re-amp your synths, use analog filters and distortion, add bass, guitar, synths or rhythm programming. If you have specific sonic dreams; let me know.

I will usually put the mixes in Soundcloud (privately) so you and the people around you can hear the progress and comment on it.

I will mix and tweak till everybody is happy. It is my absolute joy to help you getting the best results from your recordings and I don't mind to keep tweaking to make sure all details are taken care of. If feedback rounds take much more time than normal I will notify you and we'll think of a solution that works for both sides.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### <strong>Session media</strong>
Only the mixed files will be delivered. Unless other arrangements are agreed to in writing the session files (Logic Pro, Audition etc.) used to create the mix will not be included.

Please read the general [RedHouse Policies, Terms & Conditions](../terms/#session-media) about session media but I want to repeat that mixed stems for other purposes (e.g. remix) can be created no later than 90 days after session completion. There is an additional fee per track. For prices please contact me.

Unless agreed otherwise in writing and taking into account the best practices in the music industry, Client ensures that the appropriate credits of Gijs van Klooster shall be mentioned in all the label copy, artwork, print and social media related to the studio results reading substantially: "<em>Mixed by Gijs van Klooster</em>".
